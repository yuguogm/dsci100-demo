    "The \"players\" dataset is a csv file with 7 columns and 196 rows. It is comma delimited and has a header row.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset, we can observe 7 variables. \n",
    "These variables are:\n",
    "- experience\n",
    "- subscribe\n",
    "- hashedEmail\n",
    "- played_hours\n",
    "- name\n",
    "- gender\n",

    "\n",
    "The variables experience, hashedEmail, name and gender are of type string. The variable subscribe is of type boolean. The variables played_hours and Age are doubles. \n",
    "\n",
    "The variables are for the most part pretty self explanatory. Experience means the level of experience of the players, subscribe shows whether or not they are subscribed to a game-related newsletter. hashedEmail is the email of the players converted into a hash value. played_hours is the time in hours in which the players have spent playing minecraft. name is the user's name and gender is their gender. age is the age of the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the summary of the dataset, we can see that subscribe contains 52 false entries and 144 true entries. Moreover, played_hours has a median of 0.10 and a mean of 5.85. In the Age variable summary, we can observe that the median age of the players is 19, and the mean is 21.14.\n",

    "hashedEmail is the email of the player turned into a hash value. Start_time is when a player logged on to the server in the format DD/MM/YYYY 24-hour time with an unknown time zone.\n",
    "End_time is when a player has ended their game session in the same format as start time. The original_start_time and original_end_time are the times in start_time and end_time but represented in unix format.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sessions dataset, we can see that for the original_start_time, the mean and median are around 1.72 * 10^12 milliseconds. For original_end_time, the mean and median are also around 1.72 * 10^12 milliseconds."
